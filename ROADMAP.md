ðŸ”° Phase 1 â€“ Basics & Setup

Goal: Understand Solana, Rust, and development tools.
âœ… Projects:

    "Hello Solana"

        Write a basic program that stores and updates a greeting message.

        Learn: accounts, instruction handling, Rust program basics.

    "Counter" Program

        Increment/decrement a number stored in a PDA.

        Learn: Persistent state, PDAs (Program Derived Addresses), basic instruction validation.

    "Todo List" (CLI-based)

        Store tasks in an on-chain list.

        Learn: dynamic account size, account serialization (Borsh), vector usage.

ðŸš€ Phase 2 â€“ Anchor + On-Chain State

Goal: Simplify with Anchor framework and manage state with PDAs and structs.
âœ… Projects:

    "Anchor Counter"

        Rebuild counter using Anchor.

        Learn: macros, #[derive(Accounts)], and error handling via Anchor.

    "Blog Post App"

        Users can create posts with title & content.

        Learn: custom data types, user-specific accounts (using signer), timestamping.

    "Token Faucet"

        Create a program to airdrop SPL tokens to users once per wallet.

        Learn: rate limiting, time-based constraints, SPL token program integration.

ðŸ§© Phase 3 â€“ Intermediate Projects

Goal: Interact with other Solana programs and write more realistic dApps.
âœ… Projects:

    "Voting App"

        Users vote once per poll on-chain.

        Learn: constraints, one-vote-per-account logic, timestamped closures.

    "Token Vesting Contract"

        Lock SPL tokens and release them over time.

        Learn: time-based unlocks, token transfers via CPI (cross-program invocation).

    "NFT Minting Program"

        Mint NFTs with metadata, rarity, and supply limits.

        Learn: Metaplex Token Metadata integration, mint authorities, image URI storage.

ðŸ§  Phase 4 â€“ Advanced / Real-World Projects

Goal: Build production-grade systems and integrate with frontends.
âœ… Projects:

    "DAO Treasury"

    DAO members vote to approve treasury expenditures.

    Learn: proposal lifecycle, vote weight, token-based governance.

    "Solana Name Service Clone"

    Users register and claim .sol-style usernames.

    Learn: name registry, uniqueness enforcement, rent payments.

    "DeFi Staking Pool"

    Users stake tokens and earn yield.

    Learn: yield calculation, token pooling, reward distribution logic.

    "NFT Marketplace"

    Buy/sell NFTs with SOL and royalties.

    Learn: escrow, listing, royalties, marketplace logic.

ðŸ”§ Tools You'll Use:

    Rust + Cargo for Solana smart contracts

    Anchor framework for scaffolding and safety

    Solana CLI and solana-test-validator for local testing

    Phantom or Backpack wallet for user interaction

    React/Next.js + @solana/web3.js for frontend (optional but very useful)
